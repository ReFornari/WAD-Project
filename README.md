# WAD-Project
Project 
The Rich Internet Application (RIA) reflects the gradual, but inevitable transition of Web applications from the simple thin-client model of a traditional Web browser to a richer distributed-function model, which behaves more, like the desktop in a client/server model. Today these richer user experiences are being implemented with technologies such as HTML & CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, SQL/JSON, Node.js (or other frameworks), using standard Internet and Web protocols.

App functionality
This application incorporates:

Structured data in SQL and JSON formats
Retrieval and manipulation of structured data using a server-side framework
Validation and visualization of data using client-side scripting techniques
NodeJS, Express, SQL, JSON, Javascript, JQuery, Pug, HTML5, CSS3, Sass(SCSS)
